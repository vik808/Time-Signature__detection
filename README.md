📌 Abstract

This project explores the automatic detection of musical time signatures from raw audio recordings. Framed as a 4-class classification problem (3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 7/4), it leverages deep learning techniques to extract rhythmic patterns using mel spectrograms and classify them using models such as Custom CNNs, ResNet-18, and EfficientNet-B0. We work with a curated dataset of 2800 audio samples, applying robust preprocessing, augmentation, and training strategies to achieve high classification accuracy. This pipeline contributes significantly to music information retrieval, AI-assisted music tools, and educational software. 📖 Table of Contents

Project Structure
📘 Introduction

Time signature, or meter, is the rhythmic foundation of music. Automatically identifying it from raw audio enables intelligent music processing, understanding, and composition. This project builds a pipeline to detect time signatures directly from WAV files, using modern deep learning methods. 🧠 Background

Traditional music analysis focuses on symbolic representations like MIDI. However, real-world applications often involve raw, noisy audio. In this project, we use deep learning on mel spectrograms to approximate temporal rhythmic structure and identify meter without relying on symbolic data. 💡 Motivation

Most music AI systems skip over time signature analysis or depend on symbolic input. We aim to:

Detect rhythmic structure directly from raw audio

Assist educators, composers, and researchers

Improve MIR tools with accurate time signature tagging
🎯 Objectives

Build a robust classifier for time signatures (3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 7/4)

Apply data augmentation to increase robustness

Evaluate different deep learning models

Visualize and analyze classification results

📈 Performance Analysis

EfficientNet outperformed all models.

3/4 and 4/4 sometimes confused due to similar rhythm.

Augmentation greatly improved generalization.

Minor class imbalance affected 5/4 and 7/4 accuracy.
⚠️ Limitations

Dataset size is moderate for deep learning.

Ambiguity in rhythm for closely spaced classes.

Augmentation cannot fully mimic real-world complexity.
✅ Conclusion

Mel spectrograms are suitable features for meter detection.

EfficientNet achieves high accuracy with fewer resources.

Augmentation techniques improve model generalization.
